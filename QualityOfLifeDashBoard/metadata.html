<p>Total Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA) population.</p>

<h3 id="importance">Importance</h3>

<p>Total population is a baseline measure that indicates the number of people living in an NPA.   It is used to calculate density, and other per capita data.Trends in population show where the community is growing and where it is decreasing, which can help the City, County and Towns as well as other services providers know where infrastructure and other services may be needed.The 2010 Census reported 308.7 million people in the United States, a 9.7 percent increase from the Census 2000 population of 281.4 million.</p>

<p>Provides the population based on the 2010 Census for each NPA using Block Group geography. Census block groups are the second smallest unit of measure used in the decennial Census. Only the census block is smaller. A block group is a cluster of census blocks within the same census tract. The average block group contains 39 blocks comprising between 600 and 3,000 people, with an optimum size of 1,500 people.</p>

<h3 id="importance-2">Importance</h3>

<p>The median age of residents in a Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA) provides an indication of its character, including the resources and the services it may need. For example, an NPA with aging residents may need services or housing to help residents age in place.  In contrast, a younger population could need help with educational or employment resources. According to the U.S. 2010 census the median age in North Carolina is 37.4.</p>

<p>Median household income of each Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA).</p>

<h3 id="importance-17">Importance</h3>

<p>The median household income provides an indication of how well people are doing financially in a neighborhood.Lower wage earners may have higher percentages of their income devoted to consumption and less for saving, making them less resilient in economic downturns.  Higher wage earners may have more of their income available for consumption and more savings that can enable them to be more resilient in economic downturns. Total disposable income is a function of both consumption and population. Service providers and retailers look at income levels to help them locate their services. According to the Census Bureau the federal poverty threshold for a family of four was $22,350 in the lower 48 states.  The median household income in Charlotte for a family of four was $65,036.</p>

<p>Tracking the number and location of after school programs allows residents to identify providers in their neighborhoods.  The data is also useful for education providers. A low number of programs may assist in determining where and how to implement services based on related variables such as population age, population density, and household income. The location of programs in adjacent Neighborhood Profile Areas (NPAs) should also be considered to determine the level of service.</p>

<p>North Carolina State Children's Health Choice is a program that provides health care for low-income children that do not qualify for Medicaid and who are not insured through a private healthcare provider. Parents report that the program helps make health services financially accessible to their children, enabling them to get needed physician's care, eyeglasses, or prescription drugs. According to the North Carolina Institute of Medicine, there were 1,046,396 children insured through public health insurance programs in 2010, a 24% increase from 2005.</p>

<p>While Births to Adolescents is a different measure than teen pregnancy, research shows that teenage pregnancy is associated with increased risk of poor social, economic and health outcomes for both mother and child. High rates of births to adolescents may influence trends in education variables and reflect accessibility issues with health education and health providers as well as a number of other socioeconomic factors. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, North Carolina was ranked 34 out of 51 states and the District of Columbia on 2010 preliminary teen birth rates among females aged 15-19 (with 1 representing the lowest rate and 51 representing the highest rate). On a similar scale, North Carolina was ranked 37 out of 51 states and the District of Columbia in pregnancies to females aged 15-19 in 2005.</p>

<p>Knowing the average age of death is valuable in understanding the health of neighborhood residents.  A low average may be caused by a variety of reasons, including poor health behaviors (low physical activity, poor nutrition, tobacco and alcohol use, and high risk activities), lack of access to health care providers, environmental issues, traffic safety conditions, violent crime, and mental health problems. According to the Center for Disease Control more than 9,000 children died from injuries in the US in 2009. Car crashes, suffocation, drowning, poisoning, fires, and falls are some of the most common ways children are hurt or killed.</p>

<p>The average value of a residence depends on a number of factors, including the size and age of the home as well as the perceived desirability of the neighborhood.  A high or low value isn't necessarily good or bad.   However, since homes are the major source of most family's wealth, it is important that all residents share in the economic prosperity of the community. According to the Zillow Home Value Index the average value for North Carolina in December 2010 was $135,000.</p>

High increases rewards homeowners with increased equity and wealth, but can also make it challenging for those with fixed or limited incomes to remain in place.</p>

<p>The total assessed value for residential housing units in 2011 minus the total assessed value for residential housing units in 2003 divided by the total assessed value for residential housing units in 2003 for each Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA). NPAs with less than 5 qualifying properties were classified as N/A. Residential housing units include condominiums, single-family detached units and townhouses. Pearson's Appraisal Service identified that some neighborhoods needed to be reassessed. Based on these findings, the County will reassess the value of property in complex areas, particularly pre-1980 heterogeneous neighborhoods, to ensure equity which may change the values represented in this variable.</p>

<p>The foreclosure crisis can have debilitating effects on neighborhoods.  Concentrations of foreclosed homes in an area negatively affect property values and public services. Foreclosures can be found in all neighborhoods; however, the impacts are more problematic in certain locations and within certain housing markets. There are 3,520 foreclosures represented on this map or 1.2% of single-family (attached and detached) housing units.</p>

<p>Rental housing is a desirable option for many residents, particularly in the current economic climate. There is no reliable data regarding the effect of rented homes on neighborhood property value.  Increasing numbers of rented properties should be analyzed with other data such as the age and condition of the homes, design, or house size, adjacent land uses, and area incomes. A major factor to consider with rented homes is the level of management by the owners which impacts adjacent properties positively or negatively as much as owner-occupied dwellings.</p>

<p>Identifying the location of subsidized units allows housing providers to develop implementation plans and residents to understand the types of housing choices that are present in their community.

Mixed-income development has become a popular housing solution by creating diverse communities and decentralizing poverty.</p>
